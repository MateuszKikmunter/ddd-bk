# Introduction

In the last years, I've helped numerous companies implementing Angular based large scale enterprise applications. To handle the complexity of such applications, it's vital to decompose the whole system into smaller libraries. 

However, if you end up with lots of libraries which are too much intermingled with each other, you don't win much. If everything depends on everything else, you cannot easily change or extend your system without introducing breaking changes.

Domain-driven Design, esp. its discipline strategic design, helps with this and it also can be the foundation for building micro frontends.

In this book, which bases upon several blog articles I've written about Angular, DDD, and Micro Frontends, I show how to use these ideas. 

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out at ``book@softwarearchitekt.at``. Perhaps you also want to connect with me at Twitter (https://twitter.com/ManfredSteyer) or Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/manfred.steyer) so that we can stay in touch and you get all the updates about my work regarding Enterprise Angular.

## Case Studies

To show all the concepts in action, this book uses several case studies. You can find them in my GitHub account:

- [Case Study for Strategic Design](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/strategic-design)
- [Case Study for Tactical Design](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-ddd)
- [Case Study for Micro Frontend Shell](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-microfrontend)

## Thanks

I want to thank several people who helped me with this work:

- The great people at [Nrwl.io](https://nrwl.io/) who provide the open source tool [Nx](https://nx.dev/angular) which is also used in the case studies here and described in the following chapters.
- [Thomas Burleson](https://twitter.com/thomasburleson?lang=de) who did a great job on describing the idea of facades. The chapter about Tactical Design uses it. Also, Thomas contributed to this chapter.
